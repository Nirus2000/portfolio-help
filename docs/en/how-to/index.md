The how-to section covers topics such as [importing stock data](../reference/file/import/csv-import.md), [reinvesting dividends](./handling-choice-dividend.md), recording [stock splits](./recording-stock-split.md) and [spin-offs](./recording-spin-off.md), [downloading historical data](./downloading-historical-prices/index.md) from various sources, and many more. Check the sidebar or click the <span style="color:red">:material-menu:</span> menu to view all topics.

This how-to section is designed to help you use all features and functions of the *Portfolio Performance* program in a real working context.  Unlike the "Getting-started" section, which is more general and uses simplified examples, the how-to section shows you how to handle the program in a real environment with real data.

The how-to section is not a substitute for the tutorials, which provide a more comprehensive and pedagogical introduction to the program. Nor is it a substitute for the basic concepts and the reference manual sections, which explain the theoretical foundations and the technical details of the program. The how-to section is meant to complement these other sections by providing practical guidance and tips for using the program effectively.


We have added also some tips and tricks, with many of them initially discussed on the [PP forum](https://forum.portfolio-performance.info). It's worth noting that a significant portion of the information on the forum is in German, but you can utilize your browser's Translate function to comprehend it in your preferred language.
