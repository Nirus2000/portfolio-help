The [EODHD](https://eodhd.com/) (End of Day Historical Data) website provides comprehensive coverage of all U.S. stocks, ETFs, and mutual funds from their inception. Additionally, the platform encompasses historical data for non-U.S. stock exchanges, primarily dating back to January 3, 2000.

A [free API-token](https://eodhd.com/register) can be easily obtained by providing your email address. The token comes with a usage limit of 20 API requests per day. However, only historical quotes from the last year could be retrieved.

You can use the API-token with the automatic Quote Feed of PP from within PP works just fine. Enter the token in the Settings (Help > Preferences > API Keys) and choose EOD Historical Data as Quote Feed Provider.

If you have some special requirements, you can also use the JSON Quote Feed Provider (see [API documentation](https://eodhd.com/financial-apis/api-for-historical-data-and-volumes/) for some use cases). For example, the following request will retrieve the Apple historical prices from the **month January 2000**.

*Feed URL*

`https://eodhd.com/api/eod/AAPL?from=2000-01-01&to=2000-01-31&period=d&api_token=demo&fmt=json`

*Path to Date* = `$[*].date` and *Path to Close* = $[*].close

Entering the URL in a browser will display the following (abbreviated) JSON.
```

        "date": "2000-12-01",
        "open": 17.0016,
