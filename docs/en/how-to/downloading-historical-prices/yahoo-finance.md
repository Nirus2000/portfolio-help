Click on the search box at the top and enter a (partial) name; for instance "Deu". Select the correct security, which in this case is Deutsche Telekom (DTE.DE). Navigate to the second menu and click on Historical Prices (see Figure 1). Subsequently, you can adjust the Time Period and Frequency as needed.

!!! Note
    The Yahoo (ticker) symbol is visible in parentheses after the security name, as illustrated in Figure 1. The ticker symbol is a series of letters representing a publicly traded company or financial instrument. For example, the ticker symbol for Apple Inc. is `AAPL`. When there could be confusion as with `DTE` (there are two companies DTE), the market place is added: `DTE.DE` to refer to Deutsche Telekom; a security traded on the Deutsche BÃ¶rse or `DTE (default)`: DTE Energy Company, that it is traded on the NASDAQ.

You can download these historical prices as a CSV file by clicking the `Download` button. Please take note of the URL located at the bottom of Figure 1, as it grants access to this functionality. In the chapter on [CSV file](./csv-file.md), we delve deeper into this topic.

PP has a predefined Quote Feed provider for Yahoo Finance and Yahoo Finance (Adjusted Close). Please note that the Day's High, Day's Low, and Volume info is not retrieved in both cases.

To retrieve the historical quotes of `Deutsche Telekom`, enter the ticker symbol in the Security Master Data (see Figure 1, top left) and select Yahoo Finance as the Quote Feed Provider within the Historical Quotes tab. A list of 30 quotes, starting from today will appear.

In the background, PP initiates the following query (becomes visible in the event of an error, for example with ticker symbol DTE.XX).

`https://query1.finance.yahoo.com/v8/finance/chart/DTE.DE?range=3mo&interval=1d`

If you need a different amount of historical data, data from an alternative period, or you want to include the High, Low, and Volume fields, you can initiate the query manually. This functionality is available through the [JSON Quote Feed Provider](./json.md).
