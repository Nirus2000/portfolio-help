title: Recording a Delivery
lastUpdate: 2023-09-27

A Delivery (Inbound) transaction is akin to a Buy transaction, but it does not involve a decrease from a deposit account. It is as if the securities are acquired by magic, without any prior cash transaction. This could be the case for example when inheriting some securities. You also need a Delivery (Inbound) transaction when setting up your portfolio at a later date than the original purchases, without willing or being able to register all past transactions (see third option in [Manage your portfolio](index.md)). Figure 1 compares a Buy and Delivery transaction for the same acquisition.

You can record a transaction in a foreign currency by selecting the relevant currency from the drop-down menu. Additionally, it's feasible to record a transaction in a currency different from the security's default currency. An exchange rate will be suggested.

A Delivery (Outbound) transaction is similar to a Sell transaction, but -again- it does not affect a deposit account. The cash that would typically come back from the Outbound Delivery appears to vanish and isn't accounted for in any deposit account. Figure 2 illustrates a Delivery (Outbound) transaction involving Adobe stock (USD) but recorded in EUR.

Although the Value of Outbound Delivery, fees, and taxes are not recorded in a deposit account, they can still impact the performance calculation.
