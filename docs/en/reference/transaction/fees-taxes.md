title: Fees - Fees refund
---

Fees and taxes are typically reconciled at the time of [purchasing or selling](./buy-sell.md) securities. However, there are instances when it may be necessary to record them at a different time. The dialog boxes in Figure 1 demonstrate that the same input data is required: the `name of the security`, the `name of the deposit account`, the `transaction date`, and the `amount` (debit or credit note).

You can choose for a deposit account with a currency different from that of the security account. An additional input box for the exchange currency will be displayed (refer to Figure 2).
