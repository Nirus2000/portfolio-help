- **Always start with 'xxx' in this part**: The XXX part is variable, depending on the currently displayed view. For example, if the current view is "All Transactions" [as shown here](../../how-to/images/components-UI.svg), the message will read as `Always start with 'All transactions' in this part`. Choosing this option ensures that this view is always displayed in the top panel on start-up.
- **Always start with last view**: This option makes the program remember the last view (only the top panel) that you used and show it when you open it.
- **Hide sidebar ... Ctrl+K**: This option hides or shows the sidebar on the left side of the screen. You can also use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+K to toggle this option.
- **Hide information panel ... Ctrl+L**: This option hides or shows the bottom panel of the screen, which displays the details and charts related to the top panel. You can also use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+L to toggle this option.
- **Discreet Mode**: This option toggles the visibility of sensitive monetary values in your portfolio, providing a more discreet and private display. For instance, the Number of Shares, Market Value, Taxes, Fees, and other details are replaced by **\*\*\***, ensuring privacy. However, Purchase Price, Quotes, and performance percentages such as IRR remain visible.
