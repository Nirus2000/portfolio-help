Fundamental concepts such as account, transaction, reporting period, purchase value, and performance are described in a separate chapter (see sidebar). Below is an alphabetical list containing descriptions of all attributes, also referred to as fields or columns, used in various sections within PP.

- Absolute performance: a performance measure that assesses the overall gain or loss of an investment over a specific period; = (Market value at end of period + Sell/outbound deliveries + Dividends) - (Taxes + Fees + Initial valuation + Buy/inbound deliveries). Synonym: total return.

- Account: Repository or container for storing financial information, such as cash transactions.

- Actual # quotes: the number of quotes in the historic prices list of a security.

- Amount: The Gross Amount of a transaction or the total amount of money before any taxes and fees.

- Buy: transaction resulting in the acquisition of securities, where cash is withdrawn from a deposit account to purchase the desired stock.

- Change in Price (period): the difference in historic quotes between the last and first quote of a specified time span, expressed as a percentage. The period may be denoted in years (e.g., 1 year, 2 years, 3 years) or as a date range (From yyyy-mm-dd to yyyy-mm-dd). If the duration is in years, the last date is today, and the first date is today minus x years.

- Change on Previous Day (amount) or Δ amount: the absolute difference between the latest retrieved quote and the previous one (which is most likely the quote from the previous day).

- Change on Previous Day (%) or Δ %: the difference between the latest retrieved quote and the previous one (which is most likely the quote from the previous day), expressed as a percentage.

- Cash account: A financial account for holding and managing money.

- Completeness of historic quotes: the ratio between the actual and expected number of historic quotes of a security, expressed as a percentage.

- Currency: the currency for a security chosen at its creation, which becomes immutable after the initial transaction involving this security.

- Date: The date of a transaction such as Buy or Sell.

- Date of first historical quote: The first date for which you have historical prices of a security.

- Date of last historical quote: The last date for which you have historical prices of the security. It's important to note that having these dates does not necessarily mean you have all intermediate historical prices.

- Date of latest quote: the most recent date on which the current market value or price of a financial instrument, such as a stock, bond, or commodity, was publicly provided or updated.

- Delivery (Inbound): a transaction where shares of a security are acquired without the need for a prior deposit and withdrawal of funds (comparable to a buy without a withdrawal).

- Delivery (Outbound): a transaction where shares of a security are removed from the security account without a resulting deposit in a cash account (comparable to a sell without a deposit).

- Deposit: Putting money in a deposit or cash account.

- Deposit account: Repository or container for storing deposit/withdrawals and balances. Also named `Cash account`.

- Distance to SMA (days): a metric that measures the difference between the current price (quote) of a share and the average price of that share over a specified number of past days (5, 20, 30, 38, 50, 90, 100, or 200 days), expressed as a percentage. The acronym "SMA" stands for "Simple Moving Average". For example, the average price of security for the last 5 daily quotes is (100 + 98 + 99 + 97 + 96)/5 = 98. The Distance to SMA (5 days) is (100-98)/98 = 2.04%.  

- Distance to ATH (period): a metric that shows how far the current price is from the highest price in the specified period (1 year, 2 years, 3 years or a date range From yyyy-mm-dd to yyyy-mm-dd). For example, the highest price of a security in the last year was 77.4 EUR. The current price is 71.96 EUR. So the Distance to ATH for a 1 year period is equal to (71.96 - 77.4)/77.4 or -7.03%.

- Dividend: the distribution of a company’s earnings to its shareholders.

- Exchange: a security may be traded on more than one exchange. For example, the NVIDIA stock is traded on Nasdaq (symbol NVDA, exchange NMS) or XETRA (symbol NVD.DE, exchange GER), and many more exchanges.

- Exchange rate: the value of one currency in terms of another currency, determining the rate at which they can be exchanged.

- Ex-date: used in stock split; date when a stock exchange first trades the (split) shares at the adjusted price.

- Ex-dividend date: shareholders who owned their shares at least one full business day before the ex-dividend date will be entitled to receive a dividend. Sometimes also called the ex-date (see above).

- Expected # quotes: given the nature and frequency of a security and the calendar in use, PP calculates the expected number of quotes for the time period between the Date of last and first historical quote. Weekend and holidays are taken into account.

- Fees: Costs imposed by a service provider or intermediary for facilitating a transaction.

- Gross Amount: Utilized when importing data, indicating the overall worth of a transaction, exclusive of fees and taxes. Gross Amount = shares x quote price or Value - fees - taxes.

This terminology may seem counterintuitive, as traditionally the gross value of an entity (such as your salary) is inclusive of taxes.

Also referred to as `Value` or `Debit Note` in the Buy transaction input form.

- Note: Each security and transaction can be accompanied by a note for additional information or context.

- Offset Account:  In the context of buying or selling stock, the offset account is the account that is used to balance the transaction. When a security is purchased, the security account is increased, and the offset account, typically a cash account, is decreased to reflect the outflow of cash. Conversely, when a security is sold, the security account is decreased, and the offset account is increased to reflect the inflow of cash.
